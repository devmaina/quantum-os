Quantum Programming Language (QPL) Documentation
Introduction:
QPL is a high-level language designed for quantum computing systems. It is built to leverage quantum algorithms and operations to optimize system performance and security.

Basic Syntax:

Variables: let x = 5
Functions:
qpl
Copy code
function myFunction(a, b) {
    return a + b
}
Quantum Operations:
qpl
Copy code
qbit q1
apply H(q1)  // Apply Hadamard gate to q1
Core Functions:

initializeQuantumState(): Initializes the quantum state.
startScheduler(): Starts the OS scheduler.
startServices(): Starts core services.
initializeUI(): Initializes the user interface.
runEventLoop(): Runs the main event loop.
Modules:

core: Contains core system functionalities.
drivers: Contains hardware driver code.
quantum: Contains quantum-specific operations.
services: Contains service management code.
ui: Contains user interface management code.
