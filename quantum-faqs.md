## Example Code with Qiskit

Here's an example of creating and running a simple quantum circuit using Qiskit:

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute

def initialize_quantum_state():
    print("Initializing Quantum State...")
    qc = QuantumCircuit(1)
    qc.h(0)  # Apply Hadamard gate
    return qc

def measure_quantum_state(qc):
    qc.measure_all()
    simulator = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
    result = execute(qc, simulator).result()
    counts = result.get_counts(qc)
    print(f"Measurement results: {counts}")

def main():
    print("Initializing Quantum OS...")
    qc = initialize_quantum_state()
    print("Quantum State Initialized.")
    print("Measuring Quantum State...")
    measure_quantum_state(qc)
    print("Measurement complete.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

To run the example, ensure you have Qiskit installed:

```bash
pip install qiskit
```

Then run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```
